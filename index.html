				<h3>I am Aaron Paul V. Vallega</h3><br>
				<h1>An Information Technology student from University of Cebu</h1>
				<br><p>I am currently residing in Tungkil, Minglanilla, Cebu, known as the "Sugat Capital of the South." (In Cebuano, "Sugat" means "meeting"). I have a profound interest in games and computers. One particular game that caught my attention is Minecraft, and I was especially intrigued by its command block feature, which allows you to manipulate the game's concepts. This led me to delve into research, and I discovered that it was connected to coding, igniting my interest in programming.</p>
				<br><p>Information Technology (IT) was not my initial choice, but I found inspiration from someone who encouraged me to persist despite limited resources. I lacked personal access to a computer and the internet (at least initially) due to financial struggles following my mother's passing. However, this person motivated me and consistently reminded me that education isn't solely about financial resources. To achieve success, one must be willing to make sacrifices. This individual encouraged me to dream big for both myself and my family.</p>
				<br><p>My vision is to create games similar to Minecraft that can enhance people's creativity, encourage them to think outside the box, and contribute to making the world a better place.</p>
